# Project Iro

This project was an exercise to explore game development in JS (i've previously used Unity) and challenge myself with something new in React with the constraints of the browser and JS Canvas (and of course I am a massive classic Pok√©mon fan). I could have continued with this project forever, there was so much to add and it was a joy to build, but I had to draw the line somewhere. Alas, Pallet town is the extent of the map but all the interiors are in there!
